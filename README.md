Hi guys I am siddhant Thakur and here is the information or description of chiken tandoori:

Tandoori chicken gets its name from the bell-shaped tandoor clay oven which is also used to make naan, or Indian flatbread.


Skinless legs and thighs are marinated in a tenderizing mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, and spices and the meat is slashed to the bone in several places helping the marinade penetrate and the chicken cook more quickly.


The chicken gets its characteristic red hue from either lots of fiery chile or the addition of red food dye.


We're not that big on food dyes here, so we've skipped it, but if you must have your chicken bright red, feel free to add a bit of red food dye to the marinade.


You don't need a tandoor oven to make tandoori chicken! (Thank goodness). You can cook it over a grill (charcoal preferred) or just in an oven with a broiler.
The key to tandoori chicken is to use bone-in thighs and legs (yay! our favorite cuts) because they have enough fat to stay moist under the heat of the grill. We don't recommend this dish with chicken breasts, they'll dry out too easily.


The pieces should be skinless. Here's a trick though, if you find yourself with extra skins (we bought our pieces skin-on), soak them in the marinade and slowly fry them until crispy. Better than bacon.
